            <p><strong>Emoji Weather</strong> is a website that allows a user to search, text, or call to receive the weather conditions.</p>

            <h2>What is the point of this?</h2>

            <p>I made it for fun.</p>

            <h2>How does it work?</h2>

            <p>A user texts or calls a phone number that is registered with <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>. Twilio transforms the text or voice data into an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)">HTTP POST request</a> and sends it to a publicly accessible URL of the website.</p>

            <p>The body of the request is converted from a messy search query into a proper geographic location with <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/">Requests</a> and Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start">Geocoding API</a>. The location&rsquo;s latitude and longitude is sent to the <a href="https://darksky.net/dev/">Dark Sky API</a>, which returns the weather conditions. The website generates a <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml">TwiML response</a> for Twilio, which then transforms it into a text message for the user. Searching is handled similarly but makes requests directly to Google and Dark Sky.</p>

            <p>The website was written in the <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> programming language with the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> web framework. The front-end code was written with the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> library. The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/richardcornish/emojiweather">GitHub</a>. The website is hosted on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>.</p>
